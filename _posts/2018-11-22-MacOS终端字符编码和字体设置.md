## MacOS终端字符编码和字体设置


##### 1. 字体的设置：
因为不知道终端偏好设置里：

```
用Control-V键跳过非ASCII的输入
```
这一选项是做什么的，手贱就调了一下字体，.........然后就调不回来一个好看的了........曾记：[乔布斯2005年斯坦福大学毕业演讲](http://www.ioter.top/2018/04/29/乔布斯2005年斯坦福大学毕业演讲/) 乔老爷子说：

 ```c
   [04:08.01]And we designed it all into the Mac 
   [04:11.00]It was the first computer with beautiful typography 
   [04:14.01]If I had never dropped in on that single course in college 
   [04:17.01]the Mac would have never had multiple typefaces 
   [04:20.00]or proportionally spaced fonts 
   [04:22.02]And since Windows just copied the Mac 
   [04:24.01]It's likely that no personal computer would have them 
   [04:34.00]If I had never dropped out 
   [04:36.01]I would have never dropped in on that calligraphy class 
   [04:38.01]And personal computers might not have 
   [04:40.01]the wonderful typography that they do 
 ```

我只能说：好吧！……,幸好找到：[https://blog.csdn.net/qq_27325349/article/details/51519098](https://blog.csdn.net/qq_27325349/article/details/51519098) 这一篇文章，
参考了它，从GitHub下载了Solarized：

```shell
git clone git://github.com/altercation/solarized.git
```

在其中的osx-terminal.app-colors-solarized/Solarized Light ansi.terminal
这个文件样式中找到设置样式的参考：

```
Menlo Regular 11 磅
```
这个样式正好是我想要的！！ Thx!!
